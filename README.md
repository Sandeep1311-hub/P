# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website. I built it to showcase the projects I’ve worked on, the technologies I use, and the kind of problems I enjoy solving as a developer.

## About me
I’m a full-stack developer with a little over two years of hands-on experience building web applications. I mainly work with React and Node.js, and I like being involved in the full process — from shaping the UI to writing backend logic and deploying the final product. I care about clean code, performance, and building things that are actually useful.

## Tech I use
- React.js, Next.js  
- Node.js, Express  
- HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS  
- MongoDB, Firebase  
- Git, GitHub, Vercel, Azure  

## Projects
The portfolio includes a mix of real-world and learning-driven projects, such as:
- A job finder platform with search and filtering  
- A food delivery application built end-to-end  
- An AI research agent that automates information collection  
- A 3D data visualization tool built with Python  

Each project represents something I learned or improved along the way.

## Live site
The site is deployed using Vercel.  
(I’ll update this section with the live link.)

## Notes
